If you are interested in Flex and are close enough to Milan Italy then you must not miss 360 Flex Europe. This 3-day conference is the place to learn about Flex and AIR from Adobe and community speakers. 360 Flex was the first Flex conference in the US, and now this one in Milan is the first European Flex conference! Don&#8217;t miss out, only â‚¬360. The conference includes over 35+ speakers/sessions and free hands-on &#8220;Getting started with Flex&#8221; training. More details can be found at [http://360flex.com/360flex_europe](http://360flex.com/360flex_europe "360 Flex Europe Milan Italy")

I am presenting on day 2 of the conference. The topic of my presentation is &#8212; &#8220;Flex integration with a few Java EE Scenarios&#8221;. I ran the same session at 360 Flex Atalanta on 26 February 2008. The feedback from that session confirmed that many people enjoyed the session and are interested in Flex and Java integration. If you are interested, come to the show and join me on day 2.
