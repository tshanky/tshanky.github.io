Thanks to all those who attended my session earlier this afternoon. I will post answers to many of the questions that were asked and could not be addressed (due to shortage of time). Please navigate to the page titled &#8212; &#8220;<a title="Flex and Java" href="http://shanky.org/flex-and-java/" target="_blank">Flex and Java</a>&#8221; &#8212; and you will see these spread across multiple posts on that page.
