I presented this afternoon at the Adobe Developer Week 2008 &#8212; an online seminar that runs each day from March 24th through March 28th. The topic of my presentation was &#8220;Flex and Java &#8212; Tying the Knot!&#8221;. If you have come to any of my recent presentations at <a title="Flex Camp Chicago" href="http://www.flexcampchicago.com/" target="_blank">Flex Camp Chicago</a>, <a title="360 Flex Atlanta" href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/index.cfm" target="_blank">360 Flex Atlanta</a> or <a title="http://www.ajaxworld.com/" href="http://www.ajaxworld.com/" target="_blank">AjaxWorld East 2008</a> you probably know that this is one topic that I have been speaking on frequently. In the next few months you will get to see more on this from me. My next stop is <a title="360 Flex Europe Milan Italy" href="http://www.360flex.com/360flex_europe/" target="_blank">360 Flex Milan</a> and then <a title="Flex Camp Wall Street" href="http://www.flexcampwallstreet.com/" target="_blank">Flex Camp Wall Street</a> and <a title="The Server Side Java Symposium Europe" href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/europe/index.html" target="_blank">The Server Side Java Symposium Europe</a> follow.
