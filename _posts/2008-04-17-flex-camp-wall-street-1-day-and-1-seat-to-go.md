<a title="Flex Camp Wall Street" href="http://www.flexcampwallstreet.com" target="_blank">Flex Camp Wall Street</a> is just 1 day away and we are also 1 seat away from being sold out! I must thank every attendee, organizer and speaker for generating the excitement about the event. We increased seats to include 150 instead of our initial number of 125 and yet it took no time for the seats to fill up. I hope everybody enjoys the event tomorrow and promise to organize more events of the type in future.

Thanks!
