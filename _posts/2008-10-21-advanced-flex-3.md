My book &#8212; <a title="Advanced Flex 3 at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/AdvancED-Flex-Advanced-Shashank-Tiwari/dp/1430210273/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224555446&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Advanced Flex 3</a> &#8212; is out in the market! It was a good feeling to hold the printed version in my hand, as its first few copies arrived yesterday. We celebrated at home with some delicious brownies that my wife baked right then. Months of work and lot of night-outs have gone into writing it. (_Book writing can make you sleepless!_).

Its one of the few (or maybe only?) books which addresses the needs of the advanced Flex developer, who is interested in creating enterprise grade robust applications. Hopefully it is as enjoyable reading, as it was writing it!

It was a great experience working with my co-authors (<a title="Elad Elrom" href="http://elromdesign.com/blog/about/" target="_blank">Elad</a>, <a title="Jack Herrington" href="http://jackherrington.com/about" target="_blank">Jack</a> and <a title="Jshua Mostafa" href="http://joshua.almirun.com/about" target="_blank">Joshua</a>) and having my wife and kids support me through the entire process. Not to forget my parents and in-laws supported me too, &#8217;cause I was busy writing even on vacation in their homes. (_Book writing can make you ill mannered <img src="http://shanky.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />_ )
