Come join me at the &#8220;Camps and Community&#8221; Birds-of-a-feather session at Adobe MAX 2008 in San Francisco. Its at Room# 2000 at Moscone West and starts at 9.30 PM on Monday November 17, 2008.

We will share experience from past Camps we have organized and participated in, for example:

  * <a title="Flex Camp Chicago" href="http://www.flexcampchicago.com" target="_blank">Flex Camp Chicago</a>
  * [Flex Camp Wall Street](http://www.flexcampwallstreet.com "Flex Camp Wall Street")

<div>
  We will also talk about community sites, events and more.

  Bring in your questions and share your experience and ideas to make the community interaction and support better and more effective. Come and let us know how we can work together to organize more camps and more community interaction opportunities.

  Remember that I am not an Adobe employee and very much a part of the community like you. I am happy the Adobe folks chose somebody from the community to run this session. Now, lets get the most out of this opportunity and share and learn from each other.

Here is the schedule for all the sessions that are part of the BOF and &#8220;Meet the Team&#8221; lineup.
