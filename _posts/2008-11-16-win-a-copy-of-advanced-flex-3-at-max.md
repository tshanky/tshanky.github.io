Thanks to our publishers <a title="friends of Ed (APress)" href="http://apress.com/" target="_blank">friends of Ed (APress)</a>, we are giving away 4 copies of Advanced Flex 3 at <a title="Adobe MAX" href="http://max.adobe.com/" target="_blank">MAX 2008</a> next week. Stop by at the <a title="360 | MAX" href="http://www.360flex.com/max/" target="_blank">360 | MAX</a> booth, where you will surely find Tom and John (and me, many times in the day), and register to enter the daily raffle. You enter the raffle once and remain a hopeful for all three days. We will pick one winner (and two on the last day) randomly from the list of registered folks everyday and announce the winners right then. The winner goes out of the list and the rest are all carried forward to the next day. So the earlier you enter the better chance you have of winning. Good luck!
