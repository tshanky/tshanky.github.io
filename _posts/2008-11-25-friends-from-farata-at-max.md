My friends from <a title="Farata Systems" href="http://www.faratasystems.com" target="_blank">Farata Systems</a>, Victor and Yakov, were at MAX. Yakov spoke on Flex Frameworks at 360 | MAX, was part of a panel discussion on the subject and also preseted a BOF on the subject. Unfortunately, I missed his BOF, because I was busy running my own the same time. It was fun hanging out with Victor and Yakov and catching up. We (i.e. <a title="Saven Technologies" href="http://www.saventech.com/" target="_blank">Saven</a> and <a title="Farata Systems" href="http://www.faratasystems.com" target="_blank">Farata</a>) worked together (along with friends from <a title="Digital Primates" href="http://www.digitalprimates.net/" target="_blank">Digital Primates</a>  &#8212; the Mike, Mike and Jeff trio)  to bring the super successfull <a title="Flex Camp Wall Street" href="http://flexcampwallstreet.com/" target="_blank">Flex Camp Wall Street</a> earlier this year and hope to bring back a turbo charged second edition as soon as the stock market shows signs of a better appetite!

Here is a picture from Monday (Novemebr 17th) morning, where you see Victor and Yakov with Anthony T. DeBonis (the coordinator of a vibrant Flex/Flash user group in Albany, New York).
