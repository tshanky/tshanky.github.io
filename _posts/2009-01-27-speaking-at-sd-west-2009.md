I am back from the <a title="Flex Camp Chicago 2009" href="http://www.flexcampchicago.com/" target="_blank">Flex Camp at Chicago</a> and onto a lot of Flex 4 stuff. Firstly I have started writing a book on Flex 4. Its a short book that will provide a head start to the early adopters. If you are one of those early Flex 4 enthusiasts, then keep watching this blog for updates on the book. I will write more about the book and its availability in a couple of weeks time when I have hopefully made substantial progress on that initiative. Secondly I am deep into the Gumbo subversion repository these days. Flex 4 is still cooking and so the only way to continue to understand its evolution is to keep peeking into the hot smoking oven. Thirdly, I am begining a 99 part quick tutorials and tips series on Flex at <a title="RIA Revolution" href="www.riarevolution.com" target="_blank">RIA Revolution</a>. Fourth and finally, I will be speaking on Flex 4 at many venues starting next month. One such prominent venue is <a title="SD West 2009" href="http://www.sdexpo.com/" target="_blank">SD West 2009</a>, which will include a lot of fantastic speakers and the JOLT awards ceremony. Hope to see some of you there.
