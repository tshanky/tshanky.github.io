Speaking on integrating Java and RIA at the <a title="Princeton Java Users Group" href="http://myflex.org/princetonjug/#" target="_blank">Princeton Java Users Group</a> tomorrow (March 25, 2009). The session talks about the pull and push based models for communication between a Java server and a rich web application. The remoting and messaging infrastructure within BlazeDS and both Flex and JavaScript based front-ends are considered in the discussion. This session focuses on the view through the pipes, especially through those that connect the two layers. The session is a mix of theory, code and the current practice.

If you are interested in the topic and are in New Jersey or Pennsylvania (in the areas close enough to New Jersey), then come join us at the meetup. 

The Princeton JUG is a pretty vibrant community of Java developers. It is lead and managed by a famous voice of the Java and the RIA communities &#8212; <a title="Yakov Fain" href="http://yakovfain.sys-con.com/" target="_blank">Yakov Fain</a>.
