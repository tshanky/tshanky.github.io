Coming Thursday (April 16, 2009) evening I speak on tuning Flex applications for superior performance at the Chicago Flex and AIR Developers Group. If you are in Chicago and are a member of this developers group then I hope to see you then. If you are in Chicago and are interested or curious about these technologies then being part of this group would be a good choice.
