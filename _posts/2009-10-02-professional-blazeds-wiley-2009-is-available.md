    Creating Rich Internet Applications with Flex and Java
  </p>
</div>

My <a title="Professional BlazeDS (Wiley/Wrox, 2009)" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-BlazeDS-Creating-Internet-Applications/dp/0470464895" target="_blank">new book on &#8220;BlazeDS&#8221;</a> was released earlier this week. I got my first set of author copies last night in the mail. It was a great feeling holding a copy in my hand. This book was written over the last many months as I toiled with a number of other things, including working on client projects, at the same time. Most of the writing was done in the nights and weekends.Â  I must at this point mention that my family (wife and kids) was extremely supportive else this book would have never been possible.

The book covers a lot of ground at the sweet intersection spot where Flex based RIA and Java meet. It covers the fundamentals of the wiring, protocols, formats and the API that relate to the integration of Flex/AIR and Java in the first few chapters and then rapidly graduates to explaining advanced topics. Advanced topics include Spring and Hibernate integration, custom adapters and real-time data push. As the topic clearly suggests all integration discussion is in the context of the open source data services product from Adobe: <a title="BlazeDS" href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/blazeds/BlazeDS/" target="_blank">BlazeDS</a>.

If the subject of integrating Flex/AIR and Java interests you, then go grab a copy of this book from your local technical book retailer or order online at Amazon &#8212; <a title="Professional BlazeDS (Wiley/Wrox, 2009)" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-BlazeDS-Creating-Internet-Applications/dp/0470464895/" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Professional-BlazeDS-Creating-Internet-Applications/dp/0470464895/</a>. As you read the book, please let me know of any errors. If you like the book, please rate it well on Amazon and/or leave a comment behind.

Hope the book helps the folks who are actively combining Flex (or AIR) and Java to create the next set of rich and robust productivity enhancing enterprise grade applications.
