<a title="Igor Costa" href="http://www.igorcosta.org/" target="_blank">Igor Costa</a> has invited me as a guest on the next episode of SextaFlex, the Friday talk show on Flex. I speak about combining Flex and Java using BlazeDS. My talk is around my new book <a title="Professional BlazeDS (Wiley/Wrox, 2009)" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-BlazeDS-Creating-Internet-Applications/dp/0470464895/" target="_blank">Professional BlazeDS (Wiley/Wrox, 2009)</a>.

If you wish to understand how best to combine Flex and Java and extend the power of BlazeDS to support production grade scalable applications then join the SextaFlex session this Friday, October 23, 2009. Â The session will be delivered over Adobe Connect, which you can access online at <a title="SextaFlex Brazil" href="http://experts.na3.acrobat.com/palestras/" target="_blank">http://experts.na3.acrobat.com/palestras/</a>.
