<a title="Getting Started with BlazeDS" href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-blazeds" target="_blank">Getting Started with BlazeDS</a>, a DZone RefCard on Adobe BlazeDS that I authored is available online. Go ahead and download it now.

The great thing about the DZone RefCards is that they are terse and useful presentations of technical topics and are available completely free of charge. The RefCard on BlazeDS is a quick 6 page practical introduction to some of the key aspects of using BlazeDS. For more details, consider reading my book on Adobe BlazeDS &#8212; <a title="Professional BlazeDS" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-BlazeDS-Creating-Applications-Programmer/dp/0470464895" target="_blank">Professional BlazeDS</a> (Wiley/Wrox, 2009).

Please let me know if you find the RefCard useful. Also, please point out to me any errors that may have slipped through the cracks.
