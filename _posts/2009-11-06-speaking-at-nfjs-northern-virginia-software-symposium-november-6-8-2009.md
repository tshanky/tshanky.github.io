This weekend, I will be speaking at the <a title="No Fluff Just Stuff" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> <a title="Northern Virginia Software Symposium" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/reston/2009/11/home" target="_blank">Northern Virginia Software Symposium</a> in Reston, VA. The symposium, as always, has some truly brilliant speakers from the world of Java, dynamic languages and agile software development. I have 3 sessions; all on Sunday. All my topics relate to Flex and Java integration. On Sunday morning at 9.00am I Â start off with a general and broad based topic: &#8220;<a title="NFJS Northern Virginia Software Symposium :: Session Schedule" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/reston/2009/11/schedule" target="_blank">Flex and Java Integration</a>&#8220;. Later that afternoon, I explore the world of &#8220;<a title="NFJS Northern Virginia Software Symposium :: Session Schedule" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/reston/2009/11/schedule" target="_blank">Flex and Hibernate</a>&#8221; and the promising domain of &#8220;<a title="NFJS Northern Virginia Software Symposium :: Session Schedule" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/reston/2009/11/schedule" target="_blank">Collaborative real-time RIA</a>&#8220;. The session on &#8220;Collaborative real-time RIA&#8221; extends beyond Flex and Java integration and includes the larger context of collaborative applications and real-time systems.

If you are already at the symposium, please stop by at the sessions. If you are interested in these topics and are in the area, consider attending them. If you are nowhere close by and are interested in the topics, then do let me know, and I could perhaps plan a session in that geography, if there are enough interested.

Also, not to forget, a lot of what I speak about in these sessions, is covered in my book <a title="Professional BlazeDS (Wiley/Wrox, 2009)" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-BlazeDS-Creating-Applications-Programmer/dp/0470464895/" target="_blank">Professional BlazeDS (Wiley/Wrox, 2009)</a>.
