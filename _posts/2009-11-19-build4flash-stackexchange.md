My friends at <a title="Farata Systems" href="http://www.faratasystems.com/" target="_blank">Farata</a> (<a title="Yakov Fain @ Farata Systems" href="http://flexblog.faratasystems.com/author/yakov" target="_blank">Yakov</a>, <a title="Victor Rasputnis @ Farata Systems" href="http://flexblog.faratasystems.com/author/victor" target="_blank">Victor</a> and <a title="Anatole Tartakovsky" href="http://flexblog.faratasystems.com/author/anatole-tartakovsky" target="_blank">Anatole</a>), who are a very accomplished set of authors, developers, mentors, architects and community leaders in the RIA and Java communities, have set up a venue for you to ask all your questions that pertain to the Flash platform. So go to <a href="http://built4flash.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">http://built4flash.stackexchange.com/</a> and ask away everything about Flex, Flash, AIR, Flex and LAMP, Flex and Java, the Flash development community, open source projects in the space and more. Going by their past and current track record, I am sure you will not be disappointed with their great replies and excellent management. Do bear in mind though that the venue is very new. Help grow the community and help yourself by getting your questions answered!
