As I have <a title=" Speaking at 360 Flex San Jose — March 7-10, 2010" href="http://shanky.org/2010/02/09/speaking-at-360-flex-san-jose-march-7-10-2010/" target="_blank">said earlier</a>, I am on a speaking engagement diet for a few months now and am sticking to a fewer number of conferences than I have in the last few years. The place I appear next is in a conference at my home base &#8212; New York City. Thanks to <a title="Elad Elrom" href="http://elromdesign.com/blog/" target="_blank">Elad Elrom</a>, we have a great Flash conference, appropriately called &#8212; &#8220;<a title="Flash and the City" href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/" target="_blank">Flash and the City</a>&#8220;, right here in our city. Its a conference that has not only attracted a stunning lineup of speakers (including yours truly, just kidding :)) and includes some of the most relevant topics that would interest any and every Flash developer and architect but is also a conference that promises a lot of fun in the very amazing city. There are city tours, bar hopping events and dinner on the hudson. Doesn&#8217;t that sound attractive?

The event is scheduled to take place between May 13 and May 16 at the <a title="3LD Technology Center" href="http://3ldnyc.org/" target="_blank">3LD Technology Center</a> in downtown Manhattan. You can look-up the <a title="Flash and the City Schedule" href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/schedule/" target="_blank">schedule</a> to get more details on who speaks on what and when.

My session titled  &#8212; &#8220;<a title="Flash Amid the Cool & the Futuristic Web" href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/schedule/2010-sessions/day-1/technical-track/shashank-tiwari-session/" target="_blank">Flash amid the cool and the futuristic web</a>&#8221; covers a number of different emerging aspects of the Flash platform that are shaping and will be relevant for the web of the future. So, if you care about the future of the web, do stop by.

See you at Flash and the City!
