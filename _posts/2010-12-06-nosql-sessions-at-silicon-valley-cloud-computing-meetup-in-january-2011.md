After Santa Claus has come and gone, NoSQL is coming to town! Come January 2011, I present the core NoSQL ideas, concepts, tools and technologies via a set of 4 day back-to-back sessions at the <a title="Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/cloudcomputing/" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Meetup</a>. The schedule is as follows:

Each day session starts at 7pm so you don&#8217;t have to miss work to join us for these sessions. Actually, wanted to make sure everyone was tired after a long day&#8217;s work so there were less questions <img src="http://shanky.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Each session is about an hour and a half long with a short break of 5 mins. or so in the middle. There is pizza, veggies and desserts to go along with the talk.

Thanks to <a title="Sebastian Stadil" href="http://twitter.com/#!/sebastianstadil" target="_blank">Sebastian Stadil</a> for organizing the <a title="Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/cloudcomputing/" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Meetup</a> and making these sessions possible. If you are into big data, cloud computing and web scale stuff and are in the bay area then this meetup is surely the one you should join.

All these talks will leverage my efforts towards writing Wiley&#8217;s Professional NoSQL (coming end of Q1/Q2 2011).
