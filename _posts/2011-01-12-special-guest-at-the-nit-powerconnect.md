The NIT (National Institute of Technology) Almuni Network in the Silicon Valley organizes a monthly power connect networking event. I am honored to be invited as a special guest to <a title="Jan 12th NIT PowerConnect" href="http://goo.gl/5Jqlw" target="_blank">their event this evening</a>. I am not an NIT alumni (I attended St. Stephen&#8217;s College, XLRI and Courant, NYU) but do know that NIT (which was formerly known as REC) produces a number of very bright engineers every year. Although, IIT is the big global brand from India which has produced a number of very smart and well-recognized engineers, few know that NIT has a lot of great success stories as well.

I will be leading the conversation on NoSQL and Cloud Computing and would participate in a panel discussion on &#8220;Snakes and Ladders &#8211; How to climb the corporate Ladder&#8221; with a bunch of well-known and respected professionals including Bala Sahejpal (IT Director at Juniper Networks), Paul Chen (Director at PapayaMobile), Dilip Saraf (a career coach), Anand Kamannavar (Applied Ventures) and Biren Gandhi (Ex Studio CTO Zynga). Looking forward to the exciting event this evening. If you are coming to the event then look forward to seeing you there.
