My new book, <a title="Professional NoSQL (Wiley, 2011)" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-NoSQL-Shashank-Tiwari/dp/047094224X/" target="_blank">Professional NoSQL (Wiley, 2011)</a> is now available in bookstores.

NoSQL is an emerging topic and a lot of developers, architects, technology managers, and CIO(s) are fairly confused trying to understand where it fits in the stack. While these folks are trying to come up to speed and climb up the learning curve, many NoSQL enthusiasts and product vendors are presenting the usual jargon heavy, myth centric promises and confusing them further. Given this context, I have made an attempt to present an unbiased and objective overview of the topic: explaining the fundamentals, introducing the products, presenting a few of its nuances, and describing the context in which it exists.

Read the first chapter, which is available for download <a title="Professional NoSQL (Wiley, 2011)" href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047094224X.html" target="_blank">online</a> and consider buying a copy. If you find errors, then please let me know of them.

Hope you enjoy reading the book and find it useful.
