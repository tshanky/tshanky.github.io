Thanks to all of you, who were able to join me <a title="Geolocation in MongoDB at Silicon Valley MongoDB User Group" href="http://www.meetup.com/MongoDB-SV-User-Group/events/91702142/" target="_blank">at the session last evening</a>. Thanks much for the kind remarks some of you left behind on the meetup message board, post the session.  Its very rewarding to know that many of you enjoyed the session and found it very useful. I loved the many questions that were brought up and discussed in the room. Please feel free to send more questions by emailing them to me at st (at) treasuryofideas (dot) com. Alternatively, you could tweet them to me at @tshanky.

For all those who are excited about MongoDB and would like to learn more please join me for &#8220;MongoDB in an Hour!&#8221; on February 1, 2013. The format of that session would be as follows:

  * 1 hour free video session, which will be made available online by or before Feb 1, 2013.
  * 4 half-hour Google+ Hangout sessions for live Q&A.
  * Unlimited number of Q&A opportunities over email (or over a forum if we create one)
  * (optional) 1 evaluation exam. Passing the exam would entitle you to a certificate of honor.

This 1 hour session is substantially subsidized and I only ask for $25 as suggested donation to cover some of the costs.
