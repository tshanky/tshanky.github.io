While a majority of Fortune 1000 companies are en-route to understanding Hadoop and adopting it in their technology stack, startups in the bay area and elsewhere have started asking the important and inevitable question: &#8220;What&#8217;s Next?&#8221;. Hadoop for the first time has allowed us to analyze massive amounts of data without necessarily indulging in expensive proprietary hardware or software. However, adoption of Hadoop alone isn&#8217;t necessarily helping businesses make smarter decisions or unearth completely new facts that could lead to immense growth of top line. The power of scalable infrastructure needs to be supplemented with nifty data mining and machine learning tools, better visualization of results, and easier ways to track and analyze the findings over a period of time. Besides, there is the entire realm of real-time analytics, which is beyond the batch oriented nature of Hadoop.
