> unprovoked peace


war on terror  
is war and terror, again  
ravaged, torn, separated  
stretched with anger, hate, and pain  


with blurred stories  
provoked by past, of narratives, tales  
where we are the heros  
whenever, whoever is us  

revenge with anyone, someone  
not in our stories, not of times  
when sufferings were sewn,  
with strangers, friends, and even our own  

time moving, like flowing water  
wash us, agony of difference cease  
lead us to  
unprovoked peace
